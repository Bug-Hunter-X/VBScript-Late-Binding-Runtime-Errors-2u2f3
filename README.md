# VBScript Late Binding Runtime Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: runtime errors caused by late binding when interacting with COM objects or external libraries.

## Problem Description
VBScript's late binding allows you to work with objects without explicitly declaring their types.  This can be convenient, but it also means that type checking happens at runtime, not compile time.  If the object or method being called doesn't exist, a runtime error occurs.

## Solution
The best solution is to avoid late binding where possible.  Use early binding, which involves explicitly declaring the object type. This requires adding references to the necessary libraries.  If early binding isn't feasible, thorough error handling using `On Error Resume Next` or `On Error GoTo` is crucial.  Always test scripts in multiple environments to catch unexpected failures.
